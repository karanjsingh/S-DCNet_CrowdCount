## Contributions
- **Reformulating the counting problem:** We propose S-DCNet, which transforms open-set counting into a closed-set problem via Spatial Divide-and-Conquer;
- **Simple and effective:** S-DCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50 and UCF-QNRF), a vehicle counting dataset (TRANCOS) and a plant counting dataset (MTC). Compared to the previous best methods, S-DCNet brings a 20.2% relative improvement on the ShanghaiTech Part_B, 20.9% on the UCF-QNRF, 22.5% on the TRANCOS and 15.1% on the MTC.

## Environment
Please install required packages according to `requirements.txt`.

## Data
Testing data for ShanghaiTech dataset have been preprocessed. You can download the processed dataset from:

[Baidu Yun (314M)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lSqT7_9wCR4xW-rd4gyPpg) with code: ou3b

## Model
Pretrained weights can be downloaded from:

[Baidu Yun (210MB)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yIyjqdM594Q0Tdw0oBq8_w) with code: 1tcb

## A Quick Demo
1. Download the code, data and model.

2. Organize them into one folder. The final path structure looks like this:
```
-->The whole project
    -->Test_Data
        -->SH_partA_Density_map
        -->SH_partB_Density_map
    -->model
        -->SHA
        -->SHB
    -->Network
        -->class_func.py
        -->merge_func.py
        -->SDCNet.py
    -->SHAB_main.py
    -->main_process.py
    -->Val.py
    -->load_data_V2.py
    -->IOtools.py
```

3. Run the following code to reproduce our results. The MAE will be SHA: 57.575, SHB: 6.633. Have fun:)
    
       python SHAB_main.py
